## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Log Into the Plesk Panel**

Before you can configure your domain, you need to log into the Plesk Panel with your credentials.

#### Tasks to Complete:
1. **Access Plesk**:  
   - Open the Plesk login page and enter your **username** and **password** to access the Plesk Panel.

💡 **Tip**: If you don't remember your credentials, you can reset your password using the Plesk login page.

---

### **Step 2: Select the Domain**

After logging in, you’ll need to select the domain you want to configure.

#### Tasks to Complete:
1. **Choose Your Domain**:  
   - From the **domain list**, click on the domain name you wish to configure.

💡 **Tip**: If you have multiple domains, be sure to select the correct one to avoid applying changes to the wrong domain.

---

### **Step 3: Configure DNS Settings**

Once you’ve selected the domain, you’ll need to navigate to the DNS settings to make changes.

#### Tasks to Complete:
1. **Navigate to DNS Settings**:  
   - In the domain settings, find and click on **DNS Settings** to manage your domain's DNS records.

💡 **Tip**: DNS settings control how traffic is directed to your website, so be cautious when modifying these records.

---

### **Step 4: Set Up the Record**

You will need to add the DNS record that points the domain to the correct IP address.

#### Tasks to Complete:
1. **Domain Name Field**:  
   - Enter the **subdomain** (e.g., `subdomain.example.com`) or leave it blank to point the record to the main domain.
   
2. **IP Address Field**:  
   - Enter the **IP address** where you want the domain to point.

3. **Save the Record**:  
   - After entering the details, click **OK** to save the new DNS record.

💡 **Tip**: If you’re not sure about the IP address, check with your hosting provider or the service you want to link the domain to.

---

### **Step 5: Apply Updates**

After configuring the record, you need to confirm the changes and wait for the DNS to propagate.

#### Tasks to Complete:
1. **Confirm the Changes**:  
   - Click on the **Update** button to apply the changes to the DNS records.
   
2. **Wait for Propagation**:  
   - It may take anywhere from a few minutes to up to 24 hours for the DNS changes to fully propagate across the network.

💡 **Tip**: You can check the propagation status using online tools like [WhatsMyDNS](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) to ensure the record has updated correctly.

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **DNS Propagation Time**: DNS updates can take up to 24 hours to propagate globally, so don’t be alarmed if changes don’t take effect immediately.
- **Verify DNS Records**: Always double-check the IP address and subdomain to avoid misdirecting traffic.
- **Backup**: Before making changes, it’s a good idea to back up your current DNS settings in case you need to revert.

---

## Conclusion

Once you’ve completed these steps, your domain will be successfully configured and should point to the correct server or service. Always monitor the changes to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
