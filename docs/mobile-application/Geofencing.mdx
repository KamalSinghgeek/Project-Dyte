# Geofencing

---

**Geofencing** is a feature that allows you to define geographical boundaries for your vehicles. When vehicles enter or leave these designated areas, you will receive push notifications, enabling you to track vehicle movements and ensure compliance with operational zones. This feature enhances the security and monitoring capabilities of your fleet.

---

### **Steps to Create Geofences**:

1. **Define a geographical boundary for vehicles**: 
   - Select the area you want to designate as a geofence. This can be a specific zone such as a city, parking area, or any other region of interest.
   - Use the map interface to draw or select the boundary on the screen.

2. **Set up notifications**: 
   - Enable notifications for when vehicles enter or exit the geofenced area. You will receive alerts in real time, keeping you informed about vehicle movements and helping you manage fleet activity more effectively.

This tool is useful for monitoring vehiclesâ€™ adherence to designated zones and helps in tracking unauthorized vehicle movements outside of predefined areas.
